[https://gitlab.com/tdat2003/flow-example](https://gitlab.com/tdat2003/flow-example)

## Recommended development environment
As of early 2018, Atom with the Nuclide Package is one of the few good options for decent Flow support.

## Fetch, install dependencies, and run:
```sh
npm install -g flow-bin  # First install flow to system

git clone https://github.com/janmarius/Assignment-7-Static-Type-Checking-with-Flow-and-Functional-Algorithms.git
cd Assignment-7-Static-Type-Checking-with-Flow-and-Functional-Algorithms

npm install  # Install project dependencies

npm start    # Run src/app.js through node with babel support
```
